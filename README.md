The Team Lead should be able to view his/her proposed suggestions, including the creation date and the current voting results: number of members who voted yes, number who voted no, and number who is still undecided. A suggestion is a brief text (does not exceed 300 characters).

We will assume that the website will be used specifically by the following team:

Note: The style and presentation of the site will be considered when evaluating the project. Ensure the correct implementation of user sign-in and the proper use of sessions.

Each team must deliver a 10-minute demonstration of the site. The instructor will quiz the students during the demonstration. The grades for individual students may vary depending on the student performance during the demonstration.

Your team must submit the following items:
1-	All files including html, css, JavaScript, PhP, and MySql related files.
2-	Screenshots presenting several use scenarios of the website.

You are required to use HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, PhP, and MySQL. Only use the features of the languages and tools that are covered in the class, e.g., do not use jQuery.
